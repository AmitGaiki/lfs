building LFS: reading lfs book 7.0	

 create an ext3 file system:
 	mke2fs -jv /dev/<name_of_partition>
 	
 check custom enhancements of host(should contain has_journal, ext_attr, resize_inode, dir_index, filetype, sparse_super, large_file or needs_recovery only):
 	debugfs -R feature /dev/<name_of_partition>

Encountered the following problem(while updating):
	Reading package lists... Error!
	E: Encountered a section with no Package: header
Cause unknown but I guess it was because of playing around with dpkg for reconfiguring mysql
Solution:
	sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
	sudo apt-get update
reinstall lists
