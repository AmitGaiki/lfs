building LFS: reading lfs book 7.0	

 create an ext3 file system:
 	mke2fs -jv /dev/<name_of_partition>
 	
 check custom enhancements of host(should contain has_journal, ext_attr, resize_inode, dir_index, filetype, sparse_super, large_file or needs_recovery only):
 	debugfs -R feature /dev/<name_of_partition>

Encountered the following problem(while updating):
	Reading package lists... Error!
	E: Encountered a section with no Package: header
Cause unknown but I guess it was because of playing around with dpkg for reconfiguring mysql
Solution:
	sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
	sudo apt-get update
reinstall lists

Removed arch os and installed fedora 19 on virtualbox for working with lfs.
Installation is easy process but when complete another vm must be created with different name but same disk drive as that of previous vm.

Finally got the partitioning, environment settings and sources right.
Partitioning:
	Make only root partition and swap while installing. Make lfs partition later using cfdisk tool
Environment setting:
	After partitioning, login as root and create user lfs to group lfs
		groupadd lfs
		useradd -s /bin/bash -g lfs -m -k /dev/null lfs
		passwd lfs
	Grant lfs full access to $LFS/tools by making lfs the directory owner:
		chown -v lfs $LFS/tools
	Edit .bash_profile and .bashrc to set up a clean new shell in user lfs. Use su - lfs before doing these operations as given in the book.
Getting sources:
	make a directory in the lfs directory called sources.
	make a test file of all links and run the wget cmd as given in the book.

Compiled lfs packages upto section number 5.15
Binutils and GCC are the main packages..rest all are lite.
Had problems with compiling GCC..Had to install gcc c++ on host system
Had minor issues with compilation because of typos in configuration..Remove all directories and unzip the concerned package again for smooth compilation.
Parallel make saves lot of time..
