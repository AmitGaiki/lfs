building LFS: reading lfs book 7.0	

 create an ext3 file system:
 	mke2fs -jv /dev/<name_of_partition>
 	
 check custom enhancements of host(should contain has_journal, ext_attr, resize_inode, dir_index, filetype, sparse_super, large_file or needs_recovery only):
 	debugfs -R feature /dev/<name_of_partition>

Encountered the following problem(while updating):
	Reading package lists... Error!
	E: Encountered a section with no Package: header
Cause unknown but I guess it was because of playing around with dpkg for reconfiguring mysql
Solution:
	sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/* -vf
	sudo apt-get update
reinstall lists

Removed arch os and installed fedora 19 on virtualbox for working with lfs.
Installation is easy process but when complete another vm must be created with different name but same disk drive as that of previous vm.
